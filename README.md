### HW0
### Problem 1 
Running of pretrained resnet101 model as in hw0p1.py. Five different images were passed into the model and the accuracies of which can be observed my running. In order to run clone repository and extract maintaining same file structure. Modify line 21 of hw0p1.py to be desired image i.e "randomResNetPics/fan.jpg". Large portions of code cloned from  https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code/blob/master/p1ch2/2_pre_trained_networks.ipynb  

### Problem 2
Running of pretrained resnetgen to input horse image, and ouput zebra image. Run similar to Problem #1, and modify line 93 to differnet horse input image options to observe output.

### Problem 3
Observing the computational complexity and number of parameters of various models using ptflops. Included in hw0p1.py and hw0p2.py

## Problem 4
Recreating same image prediction as completed in Problem #1, but using the mobilenet model. Similarly, measuring the computational complexity and number of parameters as well. Included in hw0p4.py. https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_mobilenet_v2/ used as reference.
